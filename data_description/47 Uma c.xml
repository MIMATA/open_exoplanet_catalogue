	<description>47 Ursae Majoris is a solar analog. It hosts at least three planets. The habitable zone could host a terrestrial planet in a stable orbit. Two METI messages called 'Teen Age Message' and 'Cosmic Call 2' have been sent to 47 Ursae Majoris. They will reach the planets in 2047 and 2059.</description>
