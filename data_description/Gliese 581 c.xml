	<description>Gliese 581 is a red dwarf in the constellation Libra. It is the 89th closest star to the Solar System. In late 2010, US astronomers annoucent a planet in the habitable zone. This statement has been challenged by the European HARPS team. Gliese 581 c is likely to have a runaway greenhouse effect. A radio message has been sent to Gliese 581 in 2008 and will reach the star system in 2029.</description>
