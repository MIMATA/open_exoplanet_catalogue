	<description>Gliese 581 is a red dwarf in the constellation Libra. It is the 89th closest star to the Solar System. In late 2010, US astronomers annoucent a planet (Gliese 581f) in the habitable zone. This statement has been challenged by the European HARPS team. Gliese 581 d might be habitable according to a paper by Wordsworth et al. (2011) who studied the system using three dimensional climate simulations. A radio message has been sent to Gliese 581 in 2008 and will reach the star system in 2029.</description>
