	<description>The star HAT-P-7 is located in the constellation Cygnus and in the field of view of the Kepler spacecraft. Meassurements of the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect suggest that this planet is in a retrograde orbit. Retrograde orbits are difficult to explain with standard disk migration. Planet-planet scattering or the Kozei effect are able to produce retrograde orbits.</description>
