This planetary system is in a 2:1 mean motion resonance. The inner planet orbits the star twice during one orbit of the outer planet. This is a very stable configuration. Mean motion resonances help us understand the formation of multiplanteray systems. For example, the existense of the resonance is a strong indication that interactions with the protoplanetary disk migrated the planets to their current positions. A detailed analysis of the HD 128311 system shows that there has to be a non-adiabatic component during the migration phase such as a third planet (Sandor and Kley 2006) or turbulence in the protoplanetary disk (Rein and Papaloizou 2009).
